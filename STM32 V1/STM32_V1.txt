🛠️ STM32F405 + USB + Buck Converter | 4-Layer PCB Design in KiCad + JLCPCB Assembly
This project features a custom-designed 4-layer PCB that integrates the STM32F405RGT6 microcontroller, USB interface, and a buck converter for efficient power regulation. The entire board was designed using KiCad, with a focus on signal integrity and reliable power delivery. The final PCB was manufactured and assembled using JLCPCB's SMT Assembly service.

🔧 Key Features:
✅ STM32F405RGT6 (Cortex-M4 @168MHz): A powerful 32-bit ARM microcontroller with USB OTG, ideal for high-performance embedded applications.

✅ USB Interface: For communication and/or power input.

✅ Integrated Buck Converter: Steps down voltage efficiently to power the 3.3V rail.

✅ 4-Layer PCB Stackup:

Top Layer: Signal

Inner Layer 1: GND

Inner Layer 2: 3.3V Power Plane

Bottom Layer: Signal

✅ Compact and optimized layout for minimal EMI and improved routing.

✅ Fully compatible with JLCPCB Assembly: Components selected from LCSC to enable fast and affordable SMT manufacturing.
